# vu-progression

_Reintroducing Battlefield 3‚Äôs original progression system into Venice Unleashed._

## üìñ About
`vu-progression` restores the classic Battlefield 3 progression mechanics to Venice Unleashed.  
Players can unlock weapons, attachments, gadgets, and ranks through gameplay, just like in the original game.  

This mod is designed for server administrators and players who want a more authentic BF3 experience.

This mod is still in early development, so some key features are still missing.

## Commands

These should be considered temporary until a proper UI can be built to view these stats.

- !level or !score (privately prints to the player all Class & General levels, score, and score required for next unlock.)
- !kills <Weapon Name> (prints number of kills for that weapon, kills required for next unlock, and what that unlock will be.)
- vs <Vehicle Type> (does the same, but for Vehicle Score.)

## üéÆ Usage
- Join a server running `vu-progression`  
- Play as usual ‚Äî progression is tracked automatically  
- Unlocks and ranks are saved between sessions (if persistence is enabled)
